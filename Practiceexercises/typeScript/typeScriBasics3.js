// lets now learn about  Typescript Constants
//A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
//In TypeScript, we use the const keyword to create constants
var streetName = 'Mill Ct';
var AGE = 40;
// once const is assigned a value we cannot change it 
//AGE =50; // this will give - TypeError: Assignment to constant variable Cannot assign to 'AGE' because it is a constant
//Always Initialize a Constant During Declaration
//If you don't initialize a constant at the time of declaration, it throws an error. For example
var nameUser;
